# 📁 Project 2: Healthcare Readmission Analysis using Python and Power BI

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze hospital patient data, focusing on admission patterns, medical conditions, billing amounts, and demographic insights. It combines data cleaning in **Python (Pandas)** with data storytelling in **Power BI**.
